        "JADS, December 2020 / January 2021, participant copy, not for redistribution/publication\n",
        "\n",
        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook will provide programming exercises of varying difficulty.\n",
        "\n",
        "Programming **exercises** will help in:\n",
        "\n",
        " 1. self-reflection on programming skill and ability\n",
        " 2. to gain and improve programming skills\n",
        "\n",
        "It is assumed that participants have programming skills already **and/or** obtain those skills through [Think Python by Allen Downey (2nd edition for Python 3)](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/thinkpython2.pdf), possibly supported by *Real Python*, or any other sources of their own choosing.\n",
        "\n",
        " * This notebook is not a replacement for the book, and the time and effort necessary to learn programming. Depending on your style and preferences, and your background, you may find the *Real Python* website a valuable addition to the book. I have taught hunderds of aspiring programmers successfully with help of the book.\n",
        "\n",
        " * Note that the exercises are about *programming*, not necessarily constrained to data science alone. Like learning how to \"run\" can greatly improve your ability to play sports like soccer (and is a necessary skill for it), not all running is on a soccer field. In the same way, we may need programming for data science, but programming is not confined to data science. If you aren't already very skilled in programming, and you are eager to get to data analysis results very quickly, some patience and up-front (time) investment is politely asked for. You can evaluate your (Python) programming skills with this document.\n",
        "\n",
        "The book *Think Python* as mentioned above is highly recommended: it is concise and written by a computer science professor. It contains both theory and exercises, and generally follows a logical order. Experienced programmers (who may already know how to program in C, Java, a Microsoft 'Sharp' language,TypeScript, or any other programming language) can typically proceed very quickly through the book, in that case you may skim certain chapters and pick up what you did not know already. If you only know R and/or Matlab (or, for instance SPSS Syntax or the SAS language), you may learn a more general purpose-programming language fairly quickly from the book.\n",
        "\n",
        "As for the exercises:\n",
        " * For experienced (Python) programmers, you can probably do the exercises easily (not a lot of work).\n",
        " * For less experienced (Python) programmers: you may learn a lot, although you may need to study the book and/or other sources to get the necessary foundation/basics(*).\n",
        "\n",
        "(*) Getting a a first solid programming foundation usually takes 6 months (1 day per week).\n",
        "\n",
        "Note for experienced programmers only:\n",
        "\n",
        "* If you are used to Java (or another statically typed programming language that heavilty relies on class definitions), please pay special attention to a different *style* of programming that Python may require. In particular, you typically don't write classes very often in a data science notebook, and the same applies for getters and setters: in Python those are not typically called for, and the notebook environment is not like *Eclipse* or *IntelliJ*, and it does not typically generate code. You may want to *unlearn* certain programming habits for Python, and/or get used to the fact that Python/notebooks may require more flexilibity. Especially if you feel uncomfortable in using a dynamically typed language. If you also write Javascript, Ruby, or bash/shell scripts, you may know what I mean. *After making your own attempt at the exercises*, you may want to check if your answers to exercises are not unnecessarily  verbose compared to other exercise solutions (a metric such as \"Lines-of-Code\" may be useful for this). Verbose code may be indicative of a style of programming not optimally fit for the notebook/Python combination.\n"
